![MazePicture](https://github.com/santanca/Perfect_Maze/blob/master/Perfect-Maze-Picture.png)
This is a python program that generates a perfect (N*N) maze using a Depth-First Search Algorithm. This program also finds the most 
efficient rout to solve the maze. The green square represents the start of the maze , the blue square represents a key (which must be 
obtained before the red square) and the red square represents the end of the maze. The solution path from the start to the key is 
highlighted with a path of yellow squares and the path from the key to the end is highlighted with orange squares.
